  abstract = {Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems have been widely deployed as a powerful tool to prevent, detect, and react against cyber-attacks. SIEM solutions have evolved to become comprehensive systems that provide a wide visibility to identify areas of high risks and proactively focus on mitigation strategies aiming at reducing costs and time for incident response. Currently, SIEM systems and related solutions are slowly converging with big data analytics tools. We survey the most widely used SIEMs regarding their critical functionality and provide an analysis of external factors affecting the SIEM landscape in mid and long-term. A list of potential enhancements for the next generation of SIEMs is provided as part of the review of existing solutions as well as an analysis on their benefits and usage in critical infrastructures.},

  abstract = {With the advancement of modern technology, cyber-attacks are continuously rising. Malicious behavior in the network is discovered using security devices like intrusion detection systems (IDS), firewalls, and antimalware systems. To defend organizations, procedures for detecting threats more correctly and precisely must be defined. The proposed study investigates the significance of cyber-threat intelligence (CTI) feeds in accurate IDS detection. The NSL-KDD and CSE-CICIDS-2018 datasets were analyzed in this study. This research makes use of normalization, transformation, and feature selection algorithms. Machine learning (ML) techniques were employed to determine if the traffic was normal or an attack. With the proposed study the ability to identify network attacks has improved using machine learning algorithms. The proposed model provides 98\% accuracy, 97\% precision, and 96\% recall respectively.},

  abstract = {The evolving threat landscape in cybersecurity necessitates more advanced and efficient solutions for threat detection and response. Traditional Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems have limitations in handling large volumes of data and identifying sophisticated threats. This research explores the integration of SIEM solutions with data lakes, offering a scalable and flexible approach to managing security data. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, SIEM platforms can enhance their capabilities in real-time threat detection, automated response, and advanced analytics. This integration enables organizations to process vast amounts of structured and unstructured data from various sources, improving both the speed and accuracy of identifying security threats. The article examines the architecture, benefits, and challenges of combining SIEM with data lakes and AI, providing insights into how these technologies can collectively strengthen organizational security postures.},

  abstract = {As one of the most successful applications of image analysis and understanding, face recognition has recently received significant attention, especially during the past several years. At least two reasons account for this trend: the first is the wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications, and the second is the availability of feasible technologies after 30 years of research. Even though current machine recognition systems have reached a certain level of maturity, their success is limited by the conditions imposed by many real applications. For example, recognition of face images acquired in an outdoor environment with changes in illumination and/or pose remains a largely unsolved problem. In other words, current systems are still far away from the capability of the human perception system.This paper provides an up-to-date critical survey of still- and video-based face recognition research. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the studies of machine recognition of faces. To provide a comprehensive survey, we not only categorize existing recognition techniques but also present detailed descriptions of representative methods within each category. In addition, relevant topics such as psychophysical studies, system evaluation, and issues of illumination and pose variation are covered.},
